== News
- \[05-25-2024\] Our Physics-AI team proposed the SeC-Learning Machine: Simplex-enabled safe continual learning machine. The learning machine will ensure the lifetime safety of learning in real plants and real environments using real-time data. Thus, the SeC-learning machine can address the Sim2Real gap and learn to tolerate unknown unknowns. The demo video is available at  [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vJKpNzPLPoE "SeC-Learning Machine'']. The source code and paper will be open soon.
- \[03-15-2024\] We have opened the [https://hp-cao.github.io/project-phy-drl/ "Phy-DRL''], including source codes and demo videos. 
- \[01-16-2024\] Our Physics-AI work [https://openreview.net/forum?id=5Dwqu5urzs "Phy-DRL: Physics-Regulated Deep Reinforcement Learning: Invariant Embeddings''] got accepted at ICLR 2024 as a *spotlight (5%)*! Phy-DRL features 1) automatic construction of safety-embedded reward, given many safety conditions or regulations, 2) mathematically-provable safety guarantee, and 3) fast training towards safety guarantee. The theoretical claims were demonstrated by training a quadruped robot and a cart-pole system.
