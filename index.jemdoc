== About me
I am a postdoctoral research associate in the Advanced Controls Research Laboratory and the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), hosted by [http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/ Prof. Naira Hovakimyan] and [https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/lrs Prof. Lui Sha]. From 
Oct. 2018 to Jan. 2019, I was a visiting researcher in the Advanced Controls Research Laboratory and the Coordinated Science Laboratory at UIUC, hosted by [http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/sciencex_teams/naira-hovakimyan/ Prof. Naira Hovakimyan]. I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the State University of New York at Binghamton in Sept. 2019, co-advised by [https://ziang.binghamton.edu/ziang-zhang/ Prof. Ziang Zhang] and [http://ws.binghamton.edu/akyol/ Prof. Emrah Akyol]. 
From Jan. 2014 to Mar. 2015, I studied traffic networks at Oregon State University, under the supervision of [https://cce.oregonstate.edu/wang Prof. Haizhong Wang].
